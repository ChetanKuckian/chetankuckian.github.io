# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Chetan

I'm an **Data Engineer** an **Data Science Enthusiast** and a **Manchester City Fan**.

## MSc Data Science and its Application

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science and its Application at University of Essex.
The degree focuses on learning R Programming Language for performing Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Artificial Intelligence and Mahcine Learning with applications and Big-Data for Computational Finance.

## Data Engineer

I have worked as a ***Data Engineer*** for 4.5 years with expertise in ***Python*** and ***SQL***.
I worked as Business Technology Solutions Associate Consultant in ZS Associates with multiple pharmaceutical clients, creating different metrics and handling their data engineering systems. I have optimized previous systems which reduced the run times by 50% and also transistioned CI/CD processes to gitlab from jenkins resulting in a notable enhancement of
deployment efficiency and a substantial decrease in the need for manual intervention.

Previously, I worked as an Assistant Systems Engineer in Tata Consultancy Services, where I helped a travel company client in setting up their Data warehouse and creating different business metrics. I optimized the initial version of the ETL process to improve the data load time by 85%.


## Blogging and Personal Life
I enjoy teaching coding concepts either online or in real life and I am currently working on being a consistent [Medium Blogger] (https://medium.com/@kuckianc) with focus on Data Science and its basics.

If I am not working or studying, you can find me watching football and cricket matches or playing games on my laptop.
